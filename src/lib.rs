///   * `()`
///   * `(T1,) where T1: InnerGuards<'scope>`

///   * …
///   * `(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6) where T1: InnerGuards<'scope>, T2: InnerGuards<'scope>, …`
/// * Arrays up to length 6:
///   * `[T; 0] where T: InnerGuards<'scope>`
///   * `[T; 1] where T: InnerGuards<'scope>`
///   * `[T; 2] where T: InnerGuards<'scope>`
///   * …
///   * `[T; 6] where T: InnerGuards<'scope>`
///
/// Note that even though implementations are provided only for fixed-size
/// collections, it's possible to obtain arbitrarily many `InnerGuard`s by
/// nesting the collections.
