/// `ScopeGuards<'a>` is a trait that is implemented by collections of

///
/// * `ScopeGuard<'a, F> where F: CallOnce`
/// * Tuples up to length 6:
///   * `()`
///   * `(T1,) where T1: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///   * `(T1, T2) where T1: ScopeGuards<'a>, T2: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///   * …
///   * `(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6) where T1: ScopeGuards<'a>, T2: ScopeGuards<'a>, …`
/// * Arrays up to length 6:
///   * `[T; 0] where T: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///   * `[T; 1] where T: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///   * `[T; 2] where T: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///   * …
///   * `[T; 6] where T: ScopeGuards<'a>`
///
/// Note that even though implementations are provided only for fixed-size
/// collections, it's possible to obtain arbitrarily many `ScopeGuard`s by
/// nesting the collections.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use strong_scope_guard::{scope, ScopeGuard};
///
/// /// Prevents the slice from being dropped/accessed for the duration of `'a`.
/// ///
/// /// A cleanup closure is called at the end of the scope (e.g. to stop a running DMA request).
/// fn use_slice<'a>(slice: &'a mut [u8], guard: &mut ScopeGuard<'a, fn()>) {
///     // Set a closure for cleanup (e.g. to stop a running DMA request).
///     // In this example, we're just printing "end of scope".
